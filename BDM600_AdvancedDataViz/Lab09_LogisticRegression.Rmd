```{r}

```

```{r}
# load data
data("Arbuthnot", package = "HistData")
```

### 7.1
```{r}
# define model
model <- glm(cbind(Males, Females) ~ Year + Plague + Mortality, family = binomial, data = Arbuthnot)

# display summary
summary(model)

# effect plot
plot(allEffects(model))
```

- The "Year" attribute does not show a significant impact on male births due to larger p-value.
- The "Plague" attribute shows a marginal effect on the proportion of male births. Although the a lower p-value implies potential influence but does not show a statistical significance.
- On the other hand, the "Mortality" attribute has a significant negative impact on the porportion of male births. This is the only explanatory variable

Food and energy costs for domestic consumers are rising, so it’s obvious there’s an inflation problem, right? Well, no, not if the prices of everything beyond the gas station and grocery store are headed lower.As you can see from the chart below, the paths of Canadian food costs and overall domestic retail sales are significantly divergent.Why is food different? Because unlike in the United States, where energy costs have almost uniformly detrimental effects on overall household consumption, rising gasoline and heating costs create different economic reactions across Canada. Higher energy costs limit consumption growth in Ontario and other non-energy producing provinces. In Alberta, however, they result in more spending, as energy producers generate more profit, and wages rise.The long-term pattern is consistent – year over year total retail sales fall when food costs rise. This trend does not bode well for domestic spending.Data released Friday indicated that domestic food costs are now rising at a 2.3 per cent pace, more than double the 1.0 per cent rate in late 2013.

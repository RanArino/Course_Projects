A man suffered second- and third-degree burns when an explosion blew an entire wall off a two-storey condominium in Winnipeg.The second level of the building caved in after the Tuesday blast ripped through the building on the city's west side.Firefighters didn't immediately enter the condo when they arrived out of fear the condo might collapse.Area resident Paula Ayford tells CJOB radio she went to the door to save some pets from the fire and saw a man who had a breathing mask on his face emerge from the basement and collapse on the street.Neighbours say the man's wife and young daughter were not home at the time.They believe he was doing some renovations when the blast occurred.

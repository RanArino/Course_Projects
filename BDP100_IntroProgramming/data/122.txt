The questionHow effective are lash-growth serums and are they safe to use?The answerI love this question! I have actually been using lash-growth products (they are available in both mascaras and serums) for a number of years. I’ve found the mascara formulas disappointing but there are three serums that really do work to make both lashes and brows thicker, darker and longer: Latisse, RapidLash and Fusion Beauty’s StimuLashFusion Intensive Night Conditioning Lash Enhancer.Latisse is the most effective of the three but it is a prescription-only product with the heftiest price tag (between $120 to $160 for a two-month supply). It contains an ingredient derived from a glaucoma medication that caused longer, darker lashes as a side effect. RapidLash is the least expensive but does the job when used on a daily basis for at least four weeks. Fusion Beauty’s serum is very potent and around the $100 mark. There are possible side effects with these products, such as redness, irritation, darkened skin around the eyes and, in rare cases, discolouration of the eye.If you have any issues with eye sensitivity, you should consult your doctor or optometrist before use. In most cases, the serums will help to both lengthen and strengthen the lashes so they’re less likely to break during makeup application and removal.Bahar Niramwalla is a celebrity makeup artist and beauty expert who has appeared on CTV, Global TV and City.

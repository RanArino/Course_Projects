The Austrians came out to Metallica’s Enter Sandman. But dressed in black, Team Canada didn’t need hardcore music to come across as intimidating Friday night.There was a definite Darth Vader feel to the Canadians, who could have rivalled the New Zealand rugby team for being all black had it not been for the red band and white Canada across their chests.The black jersey even has black maple leaves etched around the neck.Captain Sidney Crosby was one of many Canadian players to give the uniforms a thumbs up.Yeah, I don’t remember wearing black too often but they’re nice, Crosby said after Canada’s 6-0 win at the Olympic hockey tournament. I didn’t really expect to wear black today when we came into the room. It’s a nice jersey.I think it’s my favourite, actually, added defenceman Drew Doughty. I really like this uniform. It just looks cool.I like the jersey, echoed goaltender Roberto Luongo. It’s my favourite one.As home team, the Canadians had the choice of light or dark uniform colour. They chose dark, opting for the black over the red they wore as the home team against Norway. The other option is white.The Nike jerseys for the Olympic and Paralympics are shared by the men’s, women’s and sledge hockey teams.Nike says the jerseys are inspired by the iconic designs of vintage Canadian jerseys, and are 15 per cent lighter than the 2010 hockey jersey.Inside each jersey collar, there are 12 gold maple leaves to represent Hockey Canada’s total Olympic and Paralympic gold medals: eight in men’s hockey, three in women’s and one in sledge.The black jersey also features gold piping on the badges and gold leaves on the shoulders.The Canadians are designated as the away team Sunday against Finland so they may not be back in black.

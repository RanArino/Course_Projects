Fierce fighting raged in eastern Ukraine on Thursday in what appeared to be a nlast-gasp attempt by government troops to snatch back territory from pro-Russian nseparatists before the arrival of a Russian aid convoy overseen by the Red nCross.Trucks loaded with water, generators and sleeping bags for desperate ncivilians in the besieged city of Lugansk began moving through Ukrainian customs nafter being held up at the border for a week, in part because of safety concerns nand Ukrainian fears that the convoy’s arrival could halt the military’s nadvance.The trucks in the 200-vehicle convoy were expected to cross into Ukraine on nFriday morning on their way to Lugansk, a city with a war-reduced population of na quarter-million people, 20 kilometres from the Russian border.At Russia’s urging, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for a ceasefire nduring the humanitarian mission.The Red Cross has said it needs assurances of safe passage from all sides to nbring in the supplies and set up distribution points, so even without a formal nceasefire, Ukrainian government forces could be severely constrained in their nmovements once the trucks begin arriving.Ukrainian troops have made significant advances into rebel-held territory nthis week in a conflict that has claimed more than 2,000 lives and forced over n340,000 people to flee their homes. Ukraine celebrates Independence Day on nSunday, and there are widespread suspicions the government is anxious for a nbreakthrough by then.Looking for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, Ukrainian President Petro nPoroshenko will meet on Saturday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has nacted as a mediator, and will sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin in nMinsk, Belarus, early next week.We are going to Minsk to talk about peace, Mr. Poroshenko said in a nstatement. The whole world is tired of war.Mr. Poroshenko stopped short of saying whether he still insists on the nrebels’ unconditional surrender.Ukraine has accused Russia of arming and supporting the separatists since the nfighting began in mid-April, a charge Russia denies.Meanwhile, five troops were killed and two civilians died over a 24-hour nperiod in rebel-held areas, authorities said. That followed more than 50 deaths non Wednesday.Troops fought separatists in and around Ilovaysk near the rebel-held city of nDonetsk, and at least two people were killed and an unspecified number wounded nin an artillery strike on a Donetsk suburb, authorities said.Once home to one million people, Donetsk, the largest city still held by the nrebels, has seen one-third of its population flee since the spring.Heavy fighting was also reported in Lugansk on Thursday, a day after the ngovernment said it had retaken much of the rebel stronghold. The city has been nunder siege for 19 days, lacking such basics as running water and nelectricity.People hardly leave their homes for fear of being caught in the middle of nongoing fighting, with intermittent shelling into residential areas placing ncivilians at risk, the Red Cross said.

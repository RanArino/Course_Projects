Ron Howard is letting aspiring filmmakers in on his secrets — and into his hotel room — in a video released by New York's Tribeca Film Festival.The 60-year-old Oscar winner stars in "Leading By Example," a digital short released in conjunction with the festival's call for submissions Wednesday.Howard first appears in pyjamas in the four-minute video, inviting the camera into his hotel suite. His first tip? "Salt baths keep your skin baby-soft for decades."While wearing a robe, Howard sketches out a mathematical formula for directing he developed during "A Beautiful Mind." Finally dressed, he prepares for the challenge of filmmaking by intentionally putting rocks in his shoes to "maintain a steady baseline of discomfort."The Tribeca Film Festival is set for April 15-26, 2015.___Online:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SymeXZx8vvw&feature=youtu.be

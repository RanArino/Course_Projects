Police in Calgary say they expect to lay murder charges against the parents of a 15-year-old boy who died from diabetes complications.Investigators say the couple did not provide medical treatment for their son, but do not believe religion was a factor in that decision.Police allege that the boy was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes several years ago and, when his health declined, he was confined to his room.He died at a home in Calgary last May.Police say tests later revealed the teen died of a bacterial infection stemming from neglect and starvation.Police plan to name the parents later today, when they will likely be charged with first-degree murder.

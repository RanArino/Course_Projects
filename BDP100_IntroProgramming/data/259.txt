The Globe Drive Aesthetics Committee, a 21-member group consisting of journalists and car enthusiasts ranging in profession from engineer to industrial designer to lawyer to artist, have voted, and declared one car the most beautiful automobile for sale in CanadaRelying upon a completely unscientific mandate – beauty-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder – each panelist first submitted a Top 10 list independently.Demonstrating the range of opinion, in the first round the group named 87 vehicles in total. We used a 10-9-8 points system to cull a short list of 23. In the second round, the panelists were restricted to voting exclusively on those automobiles. Voila, the final Top 10 emerged.

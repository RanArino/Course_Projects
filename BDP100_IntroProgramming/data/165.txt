* Exit comes only months after acquisition of the asset* Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse expected to organise IPO - sources* Flotation could come as soon as late 2014 - sourcesnn (Adds further details throughout)Private equity firm Hellman & Friedman has started preparations for a potential stock market listing of Scout24, just months after buying the German classified advertising group from Deutsche Telekom, three sources familiar with the matter said.The investment firm has chosen STJ Advisors to organise the process, in which Goldman Sachs and Credit Suissen are expected to act as global coordinators with the help of Jefferies, JP Morgan and Barclays, they added.Investment banks that have been invited to pitch are also being asked to present other ideas on what to do with the cluster of internet portals, which includes real estate site ImmobilienScout24 and car trading site AutoScout24, one of the sources said."They want to take advantage of the market while it is there," another source monitoring the process said.In January Hellman & Friedman closed a deal to acquire a 70 percent stake in Scout24 for about 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion), valuing the group at 2 billion euros or about 20 times its expected operating earnings.In a share listing, which could take place as soon as later this year or in early 2015, Scout24 may be valued at roughly the same level, the sources said, although final pricing would largely depend on market conditions and the performance of peers.Shares in UK online property portal Rightmove ncurrently trade at 17.2 times its expected forward EBITDA, according to Reuters data. Earlier this year, peer Zooplan also listed on the London stock exchange."An IPO would give Hellman & Friedman the opportunity to have a listed asset and sell down in due course," one of the people said, adding that initially the investor may float a stake of as little as 20 percent. "But that will really depend on demand," the person said.Scout24, the advisors and Deutsche Telekom declined to comment, while STJ and Hellman & Friedman were not immediately available for comment.nn (Reporting by Sophie Sassard, Arno Schuetze, Freya Berry and Alexander HÃ¼bner; Editing by Greg Mahlich)

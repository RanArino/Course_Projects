* Q2 net T$59.7 bln vs T$56.5 bln analyst view* Smartphone complexity pushing up chip demandnn (Adds analyst comment, context)Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) reported a 15.3 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, thanks to increased demand from smartphone makers such as Apple Inc.The world's largest contract chip manufacturer is benefiting from Apple and other handset makers packing phones with increasingly chip-hungry features such as fingerprint sensors and Long-Term Evolution (LTE) wireless technology.TSMC in particular is poised for a burst in sales of chips for the widely expected successor to the iPhone 5 from Apple - a company KGI Securities analyst Michael Liu said accounts for a "high-single digit" percentage of TSMC's total revenue.Net profit was T$59.7 billion ($1.99 billion) in April-June, compared with the T$56.5 billion mean estimate of 21 analysts polled by Reuters. In January-March, profit reached T$47.9 billion.TSMC previously reported record quarterly revenue for April-June of T$183 billion.Shares of TSMC fell 1.9 percent ahead of the earnings release, versus a 0.9 percent fall in the broader TAIEX index .GROWTH MOMENTUMTSMC's ability to produce more high-quality chips than its competitors will keep growth momentum high through the second half of the year, said Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Eric Chen.But its reliance on Apple has been cited by analysts as both a boon and a hindrance. The California-based company reported record iPhone sales in the first quarter but investors are becoming impatient for an innovation to shake up the consumer electronics sector in a way the iPhone did.TSMC must also guard against complacency as smartphones drive chip sales, according to analysts.Apple rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd - the world's biggest smartphone maker - recently said it expected a 25 percent decline in quarterly earnings because of falling handset sales.TSMC also competes with Samsung as a maker of chips for vendors such as Qualcomm Inc and MediaTek Inc , which in turn sell sets of chips to makers of phones, computers and other electronic gadgets.($1 = 29.9900 Taiwan Dollars)nn (Editing by Christopher Cushing)

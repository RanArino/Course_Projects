Saskatchewan's commissioner for public interest disclosure says she's concerned about the low rate of workplace complaints by civil servants.Mary McFadyen (mic-FAD-jhen) says only three complaints about wrongdoing in the workplace were made to her office in the last year.McFadyen wonders whether public service employees are fully aware that they are protected under the province's whistleblower legislation.She says her office will review the reporting process to ensure employees have a confidential and secure place to voice their concerns.The compliance review will determine whether government agencies have the right policies in place to respond to concerns and disclosures.McFadyen says in her annual report that there were a total of 11 inquiries to her office â€” eight of which were for advice.She suggests that workers must be using internal channels if they aren't reporting to her office."I want to make sure if people aren't coming to me, are they coming to those organizations?" she said Tuesday. "And do those organizations have ... the proper processes that people can come there with confidence and know that their matters will be taken seriously?"She said her review is necessary to make sure that "people who have genuine concerns about wrongdoing in their workplace have a place that they can go to and know that it's confidential and they do not have to fear retaliation."(CKRM)(CKRM)

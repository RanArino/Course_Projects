The Canadian military’s response to a recent series of suicides within its nranks is cold comfort to the families of victims, says the mother of a soldier nwho took his own life.Mental illness continues to be stigmatized, despite high-profile appeals from nthe prime minister and the country’s defence chief for troops to come forward nand deal with their problems, said Sheila Fynes, whose plight has been ndocumented by a defence watchdog.Months of testimony before the Military Police Complaints Commission, which nexamined the circumstances surrounding the 2008 death of her son, Corporal nStuart Langridge, painted a stark picture of how his depression and substance nabuse were treated as a discipline problem, rather than an illness related to nhis service.Fynes said she and her husband are in regular contact with Afghan veterans, nwho often call looking for non-judgmental support. The sheer number of nconversations convinced her that soldiers who ask for help are often treated nlike losers and drunks who had a problem before putting on a uniform.A number of suicides have rocked the Canadian Forces over the last three nmonths. While the circumstances of each are different, the military response has ngenerally been that programs and services are in place, and it’s up to nindividuals to seek treatment.So, it’s very subtle, but the message is: ‘If they can’t step up, we can’t nbe responsible,’  said Fynes.I think that’s very cold comfort to the families of the soldiers who’ve ndied. They say they’ve done everything to remove the stigma. What exactly have nthey done to remove the stigma?The Department of National Defence has conducted several high-profile ncampaigns to encourage those who might be suffering in silence, but in a recent nstatement, the country’s top military commander, General Tom Lawson, underscored nthe notion of personal responsibility.We have an expert health-care system to support us, but in order for us to nhelp each other it’s essential that all military personnel – like all Canadians n– recognize mental health issues as they develop, Lawson said.Although suicide is a national public health concern, for an organization nlike ours – built on leadership, built on camaraderie and built on strength – it nhits us especially hard.In her experience, Fynes said, the military’s reflex has been to blame the nsoldier, rather than ask questions about how the individual might have lost his nor her way.They’re always looking for ways to distant themselves from any nresponsibility, she said.National Defence was asked for comment Monday, but no one was immediately navailable.Many soldiers say admitting to a mental health condition is a sure way to be nostracized and even drummed out of the military under the nuniversality-of-service rule, which requires all members to be fit to deploy at na moment’s notice.In the wake of recent suicides, a grassroots movement of soldiers checking up non other soldiers has taken hold, said Fynes.The inquiry into her son’s death wrapped up in October, 2012, but has yet to nproduce a final report. The fact that a number of soldiers have taken their nlives since then has been discouraging, to say the least, she added.I sat in Ottawa for 4 1/2 months, and really at the end of the day we nlistened to a bunch of people line up with stories that didn’t make sense when nyou put them all together, she said.We did it in the hope that it would make a difference and we see the same nlack of accountability and responsibility. So, we feel what we did was npointless.

Hitchbot, Canada’s most famous hitchhiking robot, has made its way across the country from Halifax to its final stop in Victoria, completing its 6,000-kilometre journey in three weeks. Hitchbot arrived in a 50-foot cedar canoe with Songhees Nation members for a traditional Coast Salish welcome at Victoria’s inner harbour Monday. (Chad Hipolito/The Canadian Press)

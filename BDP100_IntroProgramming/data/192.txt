A man who killed a York University student from China in an attack partly witnessed via webcam says he was wrongfully convicted of first-degree murder.Brian Dickson, who was convicted earlier this month in the death of Qian Liu, has now filed a notice of appeal.The brief document, which secures Dickson’s right to file a full appeal, lists his ground of appeal as wrongful conviction of first-degree murder, but he writes that his lawyers will file a comprehensive argument later.The jury who heard Dickson’s case did not know about online postings about incest and underage sex, his collection of Asian pornography and complaints of previous attacks on women, but it still took just four hours of deliberations to convict him.Liu, 23, had been chatting via webcam with her ex-boyfriend in China in the early morning hours of April 15, 2011, when he saw Dickson force his way into Liu’s room and attack her.Liu’s parents, who travelled from China for the trial, released a statement a few days after Dickson was convicted saying that with the death of their lovely only child, they lost their entire future.

"The actions of our former leader have let down all these members who volunteer their own time and money to make this province a better place. This cannot, and will not, happen again." — Jim McCormick, president, Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta___"The steady trickle of scandal and waste coming from the premier's office through freedom-of-information requests, leaks and (auditor general) reports has made clear that there's more to this story. Albertans deserve to know just how deep this story goes and the only way to do that is for Premier (Dave) Hancock to call a full, judicial inquiry." — Derek Fildebrandt, Alberta director, Canadian Taxpayers Association___"This is typical Tory behaviour and it's time it ended. The PCs have become so comfortable spending public dollars on themselves that they're not even covering their tracks anymore." — NDP critic Deron Bilous___"No government official, nor the premier, is above the law. In the event that there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing, I would expect those actions be met with the full force and weight of the law." —  Alberta PC leadership candidate Jim Prentice___"We cannot allow a blurred line between government and party business. Albertans must be confident their hard-earned tax dollars are being spent only on government business." — Alberta PC leadership candidate Ric McIver___"It is very highly unlikely that we will ever have another premier who will take such liberties with public resources, but unfortunately we will now have to put protocols into place to assure Albertans that it could never happen. It is very sad." — Alberta PC leadership candidate Thomas Lukaszuk___"There was no formal oversight structure to monitor the office's travel expenses and the use of government aircraft. If Mr. Horner was not protecting taxpayers, who was? Clearly no one." — Wildrose Opposition critic Kerry Towle in calling for Finance Minister Doug Horner's resignation___"Bad." — Alberta Finance Minister Doug Horner when asked by a reporter how he felt knowing government aircraft were being abused without him knowing___"There are no parameters. It is wide open and fully independent." — Alberta Justice Minister Jonathan Denis on the RCMP review the government has requested___"In hindsight, there were many things I would have done differently. That said, I accept responsibility for all the decisions I have made." — Alison Redford in a letter released Wednesday resigning her seat . She declined further comment.

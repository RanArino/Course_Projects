There appears to be a problem with Environment Canada's Doppler radar weather station that provides information about storms for much of central Alberta.The Carvel station just west of Edmonton was listed as non-operational Thursday morning on a government website, with the caption "No-Data."Some media outlets that use radar images from the station for weather forecasts say the problem began Tuesday and that the information was not available when a storm rolled across the region Wednesday afternoon.Environment Canada officials were not immediately available for comment.Accuweather, a U.S.-based company that uses Environment Canada data, says it has been told the weather station is down for maintenance.Carvel is part of Environment Canada's forecast and warning system that detects changes in the atmosphere and the development of impending severe weather such as tornadoes, hail and sudden downpours.

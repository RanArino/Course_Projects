When Stenner Investment Partners was recently inspired to support Clara’s Big Ride for Bell’s Let’s Talk campaign by matching donations up to a total of $25,000, they turned to Chimp. A web-based service that helps donors manage and amplify their giving, Chimp has already helped more than 14,500 people give more than $25-million to the causes they care most about.Chimp reached out to mental health charities around B.C. to let them know that the Stenner Investment Partners matching donation campaign was underway. In essence, we’re seeing our donation double. And every one of those smaller donors so far has seen their donation double. The notion of return on investment (ROI) is powerful, and in this case, it means everyone gets a 100% ROI, said director Thane Stenner about Chimp’s powerful service approach.We’ve been able to amplify our donation and see it be a catalyst. It feels good.For more information, visit www.chimp.net.
